# Nuclear Energy Weekly Value Investing Memo  
**Week of July 1, 2025**

---

### **Market Sentiment & Trends**
This week’s news reconfirms nuclear energy’s rising status as both a grid reliability solution and a strategic utility for tech and industrial growth. Demand drivers include:  
- Growing AI/data center needs (Google, Microsoft, Amazon heavily engaged)  
- Policy tailwinds and new US DOE initiatives  
- New partnerships and investments from leading tech and engineering firms  
- Heightened urgency, both industrially and politically, for next-gen nuclear and advanced enrichment.

The overall sentiment is incrementally positive: there’s powerful momentum for nuclear expansion (especially advanced/small modular/fusion), but major regulatory, funding, and execution risks remain.

## 1. **Key Value Signals**

- **Big Tech Putting Capital to Work**: Google commits to buying electricity from both *fusion* (Commonwealth Fusion Systems) and *fission* (Kairos Power—an SMR startup), signaling a long-term offtake demand for clean nuclear output. These deals, while years out, anchor real business models and future cash flows in an industry where certainty has been rare.

- **DOE Fast-Tracks Advanced Nuclear**: The US Department of Energy (DOE) launched a pilot program to authorize *private* test reactors—removing a longstanding barrier for early-stage and test deployments. This regulatory facilitation could accelerate revenue opportunities for startups.

- **AI Meets Nuclear Construction**: Palantir—a leader in data analytics—announced its software will drive efficiency in reactor construction (with “The Nuclear Company”), signaling an ecosystem of digital infrastructure forming around new builds.

- **Strategic Collaborations**: Oklo (recent SPAC, high-profile leadership) and Bill Gates’ TerraPower signed a partnership around domestic HALEU enrichment—critical for next-generation reactors and a US supply chain play.

- **Major Fusion Funding**: Westinghouse and ITER sign a $180M contract to push fusion technology, while global fusion market size forecasts surge.

- **IPO and Recent SPAC Activity**: Oklo’s public listing, ongoing chatter around SMR startups seeking either funding or public exits.

## 2. **Stocks or Startups to Watch**

**A. Public/Recent IPO & Small Cap Opportunities**
- **Oklo (NYSE: OKLO)**
  - **Profile**: Recent SPAC debut; backed by substantial leadership and Bill Gates’ circle via TerraPower collaboration.
  - **Signals**: Strategic partnerships, domestic enrichment angle, close alignment with DOE pilot regulatory streamlining.
  - **Check**: Valuation (historically rich for early-stage nuclear), business execution, and regulatory milestones.

- **Kairos Power (private, but IPO/speculation possible)**
  - **Profile**: Small modular reactor company. Google offtake deal is a significant vote of confidence.
  - **Signals**: Market validation, long-term revenue anchor (if plant comes online).

- **Commonwealth Fusion Systems (private)**
  - **Profile**: Leading fusion startup; Google as an offtaker/investor.
  - **Signals**: Earliest in its lifecycle, but with elite backing. Watch for pre-IPO funding rounds and cap table changes.

**B. Established, Undervalued Nuclear Plays (Check Valuation/Fundamentals)**
- **BWX Technologies (NYSE: BWXT)**
  - **Profile**: Established supplier for nuclear reactors and specialized components.
  - **Moat**: Deep US government/defense contracts, emerging advanced reactor supply role.
  - **Valuation**: P/E ratio tends to be market-comparable, but free cash flow strong and recurring revenue profile.
  - **Signal**: Exposure to multiple advanced reactor programs, SMR rollout, and robust political support.

- **Centrus Energy (NYSEMKT: LEU)**
  - **Profile**: Only US public company with commercial uranium enrichment capability—potential HALEU winner.
  - **Signals**: Vital for fueling advanced reactors; highly levered to new DOE policies.
  - **Risks**: Small cap, volatile, but high convexity if advanced nuclear takes off in '26+.

**C. Infrastructure, EPC, and Software**
- **Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR)**
  - **Profile**: Now branching into nuclear with specialized construction/efficiency software.
  - **Signal**: Long-term, stickier defense/critical infrastructure business.

## 3. **What Smart Money Might Be Acting On**

- **Pre-emptive Strategic Investment**: Major techs (Google especially) are locking in low-carbon electricity contracts before physical infrastructure is built. Early investor entry into fusion/SMR supply chains could offer “picks & shovels” asymmetry.

- **Pivot to Domestic Supply Chain**: Oklo/TerraPower collaboration for HALEU enrichment directly addresses “made in America” energy/defense policy. This is the tip of a deglobalization and re-onshoring trend—any US enrichment or SMR component supplier could be in play.

- **Software/Services Layer**: The nuclear restart will bring new opportunities for “enabling” firms: EPC (AECOM, AtkinsRéalis, Arup), new digital/digital twins/AI (Palantir), and regulatory facilitators.

- **Advanced Reactor “First Movers”**: Policy support (DOE program) will favor companies close to deployment/breakthrough—those that can move from pilot to cash generation by 2026-2030. Early capital and regulatory champions could see premium returns.

## 5. **Investment Hypothesis**

**Thesis**: The convergence of policy, technology (AI/data center demand), and strategic investment from leading corporates is catalyzing a new nuclear buildout cycle—especially in the US. *First-mover* advanced fission and fusion startups, US-centric enrichment supply, and key enabling technologies (digital/twin/AI/construction) stand to generate outsize returns, particularly ahead of confirmed revenue streams in the early 2030s.

- **Core Bets**: 
  - **Oklo** — if price corrects—offers a uniquely exposed pure play on the regulatory shift and DOE pilot program.
  - **Centrus Energy** — levered, high-risk/high-reward play on domestic HALEU enrichment.
  - **BWX Technologies** — lower-risk, steady exposure to SMR and advanced builds, and possible defense tailwinds.

- **Venture/Aggressive**: 
  - Track private rounds (Commonwealth Fusion, Kairos Power); watch for IPO or secondary liquidity events.
  - Monitor “picks and shovels” suppliers (engineering, digital, sensing, permitting).

- **Catalysts**: 
  - DOE pilot selections and project starts (late 2025/2026).
  - Google/Microsoft/other tech-driven PPAs or partnerships.
  - US and UK regulatory acceleration or major political support.

**Risks**: Execution slippage, cost overruns, regulatory reversals, or overhyped/illiquid microcaps. Fusion commercial viability remains >5-7 years out.

## **Bottom Line:**
*The investable landscape for nuclear is evolving rapidly—value investors should focus on companies bridging policy tailwind into real commercial assets, with an eye for US-centric supply, strategic contracts, and digital enablement of an emerging nuclear buildout cycle. Small/underfunded public names could offer asymmetric re-rating as the cycle unfolds.*
