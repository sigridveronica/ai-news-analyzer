# Nuclear Energy: Value Investing Focus – Week Ending 2/June/2025

---
## Intro: Market Context and Week Summary

Nuclear energy took center stage this week, driven by major executive moves in U.S. energy policy, heightened demand from AI/data centers, and investor/VC excitement about SMRs (small modular reactors). With Trump’s administration rolling out pro-nuclear executive orders and Europe/Asia accelerating new builds, public and private capital is steadily shifting back into nuclear plays. The macro environment is bullish: regulatory timelines are shortening, capital support is rising, and energy stability/cleanliness place nuclear above wind and solar in AI-focused grid conversations. On the ground: several companies (including Oklo, BWX Technologies, and Centrus) received analyst upgrades, utilities are racing to deploy SMRs, and nuclear-tech startups are pulling in fresh VC funds. Smart money is watching supply chains (uranium), next-gen reactors, and infrastructure/enabling tech for nuclear’s new "golden age."

## 5. Investment Hypothesis

**Thesis:**  
Recent regulatory and policy catalysts have created a structural tailwind for both incumbent and next-gen nuclear energy firms, particularly those exposed to SMRs, uranium refining, and critical enabling tech/software. The current market underappreciates the scale and allocation speed of coming capital inflows (from utilities, governments, and data cloud majors). Valuations (esp. in uranium and contractors) remain attractive on a P/E and FCF basis compared to wind/solar.

- **Buy candidates:** Oklo (OKLO), Centrus (LEU), BWX Technologies (BWXT), Paladin (PDN.AX), NuScale (SMR)
- **Venture/early-exposure:** Consider gaining VC fund/PE exposure to emerging nuclear tech/software infrastructure (e.g., Atomic Canyon, Kairos Power).
- **Rationale:** U.S./global policy, increased AI power grid demand, and high barriers to entry combine for exceptional medium/long-term risk/reward—especially after this week’s “regime change” in sentiment and regulation.

**Monitor:**  
New contract wins for SMR developers. U.S. uranium production and enrichment capacity (LEU). Expansion or new partnerships with tech/utility majors. Insider ownership trends and further analyst coverage for nuclear sector plays.

---

### Overall: This week’s news offers a clear “green light” for value investors in nuclear, particularly those seeking both deep value (LEU, BWXT) and long-tail growth via platform/SMR innovators (OKLO, Kairos, NuScale). U.S. government and major tech-firm endorsement serves as powerful affirmation for the sector’s re-rating.
