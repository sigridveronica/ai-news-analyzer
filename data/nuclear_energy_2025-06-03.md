# Nuclear Energy Value Investing Memo ‚Äì Week Ending 2/June/2025

## General Situation & Market Summary

This week marks a decisive shift for nuclear energy, fueled by sweeping pro-nuclear executive orders from the Trump administration, robust bipartisan support at the state and federal levels, and increased corporate demand from hyperscale data center operators such as Meta and Google [[1](https://www.forbes.com/sites/billfrist/2025/05/29/powering-the-future-why-america-must-double-down-on-nuclear-energy/)][[2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ianpalmer/2025/05/27/gas-nuclear-renewables-battle-over-power-for-metas-new-data-center/)][[3](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/01/tide-turning-europe-beyond-favour-nuclear-power)]. The "nuclear renaissance" is manifest in regulatory accelerations, increased federal and state funding, and strategic contracts with Big Tech. Notably, the news cycle includes upgrades for nuclear stocks, significant venture funding rounds for AI-driven nuclear ventures, and government-backed SMR builds‚Äîplus ripple effects for upstream uranium miners.

**Market sentiment** is bullish on nuclear equities and technology providers. There's tangible momentum pouring into both legacy and disruptive names (especially SMR- and AI-aligned startups), although investors should note that capital costs and regulatory delays remain stubborn risks.

## 5. Investment Hypothesis

The current newsflow marks a **structural inflection point for nuclear energy in the US and allied markets**. Catalyst stacking ‚Äî from bipartisan support, federal and state grants, White House executive orders, to urgent demand from hyperscale data centers and defense ‚Äî is driving multiple fundamental and trigger events:

- **Oklo (OKLO):** Early-stage, speculative but with tech and regulatory moats, institutional and insider backing, and direct ties to US policy. Potential 5‚Äì10x if it achieves early commercial milestones.
- **Centrus Energy (LEU):** Profitable, unique ‚Äúpicks and shovels‚Äù play on US fuel sovereignty, undervalued relative to new cash flows and policy tailwinds.
- **BWX Technologies (BWXT):** Mid-/large cap with recession-resistant defense and civil reactor businesses; ideal for institutional portfolios seeking balance.
- **Atomic Canyon:** Private, but a ‚Äúfuture pick-and-shovel‚Äù for digital ops in nuclear‚Äîevidence of VC smart money converging on the sector.

**Downside risks:** Regulatory overhangs, cost overruns, and safety/lobbying backlash could impede rapid nuclear scaling‚Äîtempering parabolic runs.

**Conclusion:**  
**This week‚Äôs news cements nuclear as a durable, high-growth infrastructure theme for the next decade with both policy and institutional tailwinds.** Well-run, undervalued or newly upgraded public nuclear stocks‚Äîespecially with alignment to supply (LEU), defense (BWXT), and innovative new build (OKLO)‚Äîpresent strong upside. Meanwhile, closely follow VC and Big Tech‚Äôs footprints for future SMR and AI-software-linked deals.
